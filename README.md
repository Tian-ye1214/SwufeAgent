RedLotus is an AI agent that runs in your terminal. It chooses how to handle each request based on its complexity: work directly, delegate a focused task to one Worker, or ask a Manager to break down and coordinate a larger job. It supports OpenAI-compatible model APIs and includes memory, runtime Skills, file extraction, browser automation, and chat bot integrations.

```bash
pip install "redlotus @ git+https://github.com/Tian-ye1214/RedLotus.git"
redlotus
```

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Multi-agent orchestration | The Coordinator selects the execution path. For complex work, the Manager creates dependent tasks and Workers execute them in dependency-aware batches. |
| Goal mode | RedLotus keeps iterating toward a defined goal until it finishes. Additional user input can be incorporated while the goal is running. |
| Short- and long-term memory | Short-term memory is stored in LanceDB for semantic retrieval. Long-term memory preserves user preferences and assistant working habits across conversations. |
| Runtime Skills | `SKILL.md` files provide instructions, references, and scripts on demand. Skill directories are rescanned at the start of each user turn, so newly installed skills do not require a restart. |
| File and media handling | RedLotus can read images and extract content from PDF, Word, Excel, HTML, Markdown, CSV, JSON, and text files. PDF extraction preserves page text, tables, links, and embedded images. |
| Review workflow and safeguards | The full-screen TUI includes hunk-by-hunk diff review. Runtime safeguards include path sandboxing, dangerous-command blocking, and child-process cleanup. |

Optional capabilities include browser automation, image generation, QQ integration through NapCat / OneBot, and a WeChat bot.

## How it works

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    U["User request"] --> C{"Coordinator"}
    C -->|Simple task| T["Use tools directly"]
    C -->|Focused task| W0["Single Worker"]
    C -->|Complex task| M["Manager planning"]
    M --> D["Dependency-aware task list"]
    D --> W1["Worker 1"]
    D --> W2["Worker 2"]
    D --> W3["Worker 3"]
    W1 --> R["Combined result"]
    W2 --> R
    W3 --> R
    MEM["Short- and long-term memory"] -.-> C
    MEM -.-> M
    SK["Skills"] -.-> W0
    SK -.-> W1
```

- The Coordinator handles straightforward requests directly with tools.
- A single independent task can be delegated to a temporary Worker.
- Complex requests go to the Manager. Task definitions are checked for duplicate IDs, unknown dependencies, and dependency cycles before execution.
- Planning and execution roles can use different models to balance capability, latency, and cost.

## Installation

RedLotus requires Python 3.12 or later and supports Windows, Linux, and macOS.

### Install from GitHub

```bash
pip install "redlotus @ git+https://github.com/Tian-ye1214/RedLotus.git"
redlotus
```

To install the command in an isolated environment, use `uv`:

```bash
uv tool install git+https://github.com/Tian-ye1214/RedLotus.git
```

After a PyPI release is available, `pip install redlotus` and `uv tool install redlotus` can be used instead.

### Optional dependencies

```bash
pip install "redlotus[browser] @ git+https://github.com/Tian-ye1214/RedLotus.git"  # Browser automation
pip install "redlotus[bots] @ git+https://github.com/Tian-ye1214/RedLotus.git"     # QQ and WeChat bots
pip install "redlotus[viz] @ git+https://github.com/Tian-ye1214/RedLotus.git"      # Plotting and image tools
pip install "redlotus[all] @ git+https://github.com/Tian-ye1214/RedLotus.git"      # All optional dependencies
```

Install Chromium before using browser automation:

```bash
playwright install chromium
```

## Initial configuration

On first launch, RedLotus creates `config.json` in the platform-specific user configuration directory:

| Platform | Configuration directory |
|----------|-------------------------|
| Windows | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\RedLotus` |
| Linux | `~/.config/RedLotus` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/RedLotus` |

At minimum, configure the model API endpoint and key:

```json
{
  "BASE_URL": "https://your-api.example.com/v1",
  "API_KEY": "your-api-key"
}
```

RedLotus accepts OpenAI-compatible APIs. Manager, Worker, Coordinator, and Compressor models can be configured independently. Vector retrieval and reranking use `SILICONFLOW_BASE`, `SILICONFLOW_KEY`, and `RAG_models`.

The same values can be supplied through environment variables or a nearby `.env` file. Do not commit configuration files that contain real API keys.

## Terminal usage

Use `Shift+Tab` to cycle through the three TUI run modes:

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| Review | File writes are collected for hunk-by-hunk approval or rejection. |
| Pass-through | File changes are written directly without entering the review queue. |
| Goal | RedLotus continues working toward a goal until it finishes or the user stops it. |

Common shortcuts:

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Shift+Tab` | Switch run mode |
| `Ctrl+R` | Open the pending-change review |
| `Ctrl+C` | Stop the current turn |
| `Ctrl+Q` | Exit |
| `@path` | Reference a local text file, with Tab completion |

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/help` | Show help |
| `/clear` | Clear context and start a new conversation |
| `/pwd` · `/cd <path>` | Show or change the working directory |
| `/load` | Load a saved conversation for the current workspace |
| `/config` · `/context` · `/panel` | Show configuration, context usage, or the runtime overview |
| `/skills` | List loaded Skills |
| `/LTM show` · `/STM show` | Show long- or short-term memory |
| `/agent` · `/effort` | Inspect or change role models and reasoning settings |
| `/api` · `/api embedding` | Configure the main model or retrieval API |
| `/compress` | Compress Manager and Coordinator context |
| `/status` · `/trace` · `/tasks` | Inspect lifecycle, invocation traces, and task status |
| `/stop` · `/cancel` | Stop the current turn or cancel an invocation |

</details>

## Skills

Each Skill is organized around a `SKILL.md` entry point. RedLotus initially loads only the skill name and summary, then reads full instructions, references, and scripts when needed. This keeps unrelated material out of the active context.

The repository currently includes skills for:

- Cryptocurrency backtesting and TA-Lib technical analysis
- Browser automation and web scraping
- FLUX image generation and prompting guidance
- Agentic coding and CI/CD workflows
- Skill creation, management, and pre-installation review

Compatible skills can also be installed while RedLotus is running:

```bash
npx clawhub --dir skills install <slug>
```

New skills are discovered automatically on subsequent user turns.

## Files and data

- User-level data: logs, LanceDB short-term memory, and long-term memory are stored in the platform user data directory and remain available across workspaces.
- Workspace data: conversation snapshots are stored in `.redlotus/`, while Agent artifacts are written to `WorkDatabase/` in the current working directory.
- Changing directories with `/cd` loads the conversation data associated with that workspace.

## QQ and WeChat bots

Install the bot dependencies:

```bash
pip install "redlotus[bots] @ git+https://github.com/Tian-ye1214/RedLotus.git"
```

Start either integration:

```bash
python -m redlotus.API.QQ
python -m redlotus.API.WeChat
```

QQ integration requires [NapCat](https://github.com/NapNeko/NapCatQQ) with a configured OneBot WebSocket endpoint, bot QQ number, and WebUI token. The WeChat integration prompts for QR-code login at startup.

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tian-ye1214/RedLotus.git
cd RedLotus

pip install -e ".[dev]"
python main.py
pytest -q
```

Build the Python package:

```bash
uv build
```

Build a PyInstaller application directory:

```bash
pip install ".[build]"
pyinstaller build.spec
```

The main package lives in `src/redlotus/`. The `redlotus` command maps to `redlotus.agent_core.entrypoint:main`.
